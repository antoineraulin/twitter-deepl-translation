A chrome extension that replaces Microsoft translation with the deepl translation engine on Twitter.

## Installation
### Developer mode :
Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (vivaldi://extensions), activate the developer mode, click on "Load uncompressed extension...", and select the folder of the downloaded extension.

### With the compressed file .crx
Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (vivaldi://extensions), drag and drop the deeper.crx file into the extensions tab. Accept installation.

## Usage
go to twitter, a "translate with deepl" button appears under the translatable tweets. Click on it, and... Here you go!

## Additional information :
This extension uses reverse engineering to communicate with DeepL's Api, so it is an undocumented Api. As a result, the methods employed may not be the most effective but have the merit of working. Linguee (editor of DeepL) can terminate this api at any time, or modify it. We are in no way affiliated with Linguee. This extension is unofficial.
